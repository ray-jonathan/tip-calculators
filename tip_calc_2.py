# Prompt or Question
## Prompt the user for two things:

# The total bill amount
# The level of service, which can be one of the following: good, fair, or bad
# Calculate the tip amount and the total amount (bill amount + tip amount). The tip percentage based on the level of service is based on:

# good -> 20%
# fair -> 15%
# bad -> 10%

# Allow the ability to divide the check into a equal parts amount a number of people. The user will enter the number of people to be divided amongst.

#######
# Setup
